# Youtube-Downloader-Python
This is the Youtube Downloader made by me using the Tkinter framework and Python

Usage Guide:
  Just run the python program and the tkinter window will be opened.
  Just enter the URL of the video that you want to download from youtube and click the download button.
  And you are done.
  The video will be downloaded in the same folder as of the python program.
